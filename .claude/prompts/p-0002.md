It wouldn't be bad if we had a very robust, enterprise-grade(do not use the word 'Enterprise' in your code or docs), set of analytics endpoint for analysize the performance of the systems in different ways.

Different endpoints some for charts, some for line comparism & historic charts, some for simple list with quick summary texts, for Logs and more details.

And different analytics.


All these endpoints must use actual data from the database and not 'Mock Data'.


use Doctrine's DQL for your query and make sure that they are optimized.


Some anlytics data should also have links leading to more specific data group for more indept analysis.

You get the idea, you are a pro on this.


Then generate a clear straight forward documentation for this and how to consume them on the user interface.

make sure all docs are properly linked.
